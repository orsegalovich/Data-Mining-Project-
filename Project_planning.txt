Data enrichment: 
	* identifying origin by last name for  defendants and lawyers
	* ranking cases by female judge count and female defendants and lawyers
	* identifying origin of judges
	* optional: ranking cases by ruling length, amount of topics, and amount of judges 

Processing:
	* check correlation between judge exp and overuling previous vertics
	* mapping judges to cases - If affected by: seniority, origin, gender
	* Calculating life duration of cases
	* calcualting life duration to amount of cases ratio
	
	
Processing after data enrichment:




Status:
	* word length - done
	* calculate amount of mutual cases per pair of judges - done
	* calcualting life duration - done
	* visualization of pairs - done

Present to Dafna:
	* calcualting life duration:
		* we have: duration for each case
		* to ask: is it correct to calcuate according soly to supreme court duration ?
		
	* Calculating case weight:
		* we have: verdict length, amount of judges, unanomus, amount of hearings
		* we want:
		* Decision tree
		* Use cases of more than 3 judges for training ?
		* All leading to "SACHEVET" - wanting to check life duration to weight ratio
	
	* Leniancy by origin\gender:
		* we want:
			* to identify each judge + lawyers + subject by atnicety and gender
			* to rate every case according to judges and lawyers
			* check for correlation / discorrelatio according to these
		* How to correlate? reccomendation ?
		
	* judges experience:
		* we want:
			* calculate avg experience for each case
			* check for correlation between experience and tendency and overruling
	
	* Cliques in Judges:
		* we have:
		* a computation of how many mutual cases each pair of judges worked on
		* a basic graph calculating it
		* we want:
			* calculate graph according to total amount of cases that the pair have appeared
			* to calculate cliques on the graph
			* to calculate graph and cliques by specific topics
			* to calculate graph and cliques by trios
	
	
Meeting with DafiDaf - summary:

Graph - The way to normalize the edges in the graph is to calculate the E of how many times two judges should aprear if it was random in comparison to the 	   empirical findings. Then to remove all the "thin" edges (remove the noise, some part of sd from the center) and to diagnose by that the connections.

Decision tree - The idea at the begining to predict categorical value of cases doesn't fit a good size to predict, therefore a good idea is to predict the cases that would be in minority opinion, or to predict % of 'Sachevet'.

All the rest was a lot of well done, I am satisfied with your direction etc. 

AMIR! read it.
