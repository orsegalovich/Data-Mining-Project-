Data enrichment: 
	* identifying origin by last name for  defendants and lawyers
	* ranking cases by female judge count and female defendants and lawyers
	* identifying origin of judges
	* optional: ranking cases by ruling length, amount of topics, and amount of judges 

Processing:
	* check correlation between judge exp and overuling previous vertics
	* mapping judges to cases - If affected by: seniority, origin, gender
	* Calculating life duration of cases
	* calcualting life duration to amount of cases ratio
	
	
Processing after data enrichment:




Status:
	* word length - done
	* calculate amount of mutual cases per pair of judges - done
	* calcualting life duration - done
	* visualization of pairs - done

Present to Dafna:
	* calcualting life duration:
		* we have: duration for each case
		* to ask: is it correct to calcuate according soly to supreme court duration ?
		
	* Calculating case weight:
		* we have: verdict length, amount of judges, unanomus, amount of hearings
		* we want:
		* Decision tree
		* Use cases of more than 3 judges for training ?

	* Leniancy by origin\gender:
		* we want:
			* to identify each judge + lawyers + subject by atnicety and gender
			* to rate every case according to judges and lawyers
			* check for correlation / discorrelatio according to these

	* Cliques in Judges:
		* we have:
		* a computation of how many mutual cases each pair of judges worked on
		* a basic graph calculating it
		* we want:
			* to calculate cliques on the graph
			* to calculate graph and cliques by specific topics
			* to calculate graph and cliques by trios
